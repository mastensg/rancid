This is my entry for Sonen Game Jam Spring 2013. The theme was "Escape".

You control a ship with the joystick.
The object of the game is to get to the opening at the top of the screen,
while avoiding the red barriers in the middle.
Use the joystick button to fire a piece of the ship to destroy barriers.

I used the Amiga 1200 that I borrowed from Peter Petterson. At first, I made
some stuff in assembly. Then, a few hours before the deadline on Sunday, I
installed AMOS and started from scratch. Rancid.AMOS is the result. I did not
win.

I think Stian Valle made the screenshot.
