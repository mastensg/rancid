rancid
======

My entry for Sonen Game Jam Spring 2013. The theme was "Escape".

I used the Amiga 1200 that I borrowed from Peter Petterson. At first, I made
some stuff in assembly. Then, a few hours before the deadline on Sunday, I
installed AMOS and started from scratch. Rancid.AMOS is the result. I did not
win.

I think Stian Valle made the screenshot.
